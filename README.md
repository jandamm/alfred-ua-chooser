# Alfred Universal Action Chooser
Alfred universal action to select items

This is a small workflow which works for multiple items and allows you to select any item to further process with universal actions.
You can also `cmd+enter` to select everything except the current item.

Another goodie is that it allows you to convert text like `www.alfredapp.com` to a url which is recognized by Alfred (prefixing `https://`) using `option`.

It works with mixed items as well as uniform items.
